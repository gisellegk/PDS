Timer uses 100MHz clock - 10 ns period

zero:
350 ns / 800 ns
[20, 50] / [65, 95] Clock 

one: 
700 ns / 600 ns
[55, 85] / [45, 75]

reset: 
LOW >50,000 ns
at least 5,000 clock cycles


r16 = GPIO_IO
r17 = TIMER_START_LSB
r18 = TIMER_CTRL
r19 = TIMER_STATUS

- make it just write 1's
- make it write zeros
- write an arbitrary number out


- Decide / create frame of colors (ie. GRB GRB GRB for a 3 color pattern)
- send the reset code 
- send out the bits one at a time until all LEDs have been lit (some sort of counter thing & it should just repeat the pattern)
